## Todo 1: Baseline Freeze (2026-07-29)

### Decision 1: Package structure
**What**: Project uses `hatchling` + `packages = ["sim"]` for wheel build, with `sim/` as the root package.
**Why**: Existing codebase uses `sim/` as the import root (PYTHONPATH=sim). Hatchling needs explicit package config.
**Alternatives**: Could have used `setuptools` with `find:` but hatchling is simpler and modern.

### Decision 2: Pytest config dual-location
**What**: Markers registered in both `pytest.ini` and `pyproject.toml [tool.pytest.ini_options]`.
**Why**: `pytest.ini` takes precedence and was pre-existing; `pyproject.toml` provides the canonical config. Both ensure marker warnings are suppressed regardless of which config pytest reads.

### Decision 3: Golden contract scope
**What**: Freeze only CLI flags, exit codes, JSON field names, and units — NOT frequency-dependent numeric values.
**Why**: The current code has a known bug where `--freq` does not propagate. Freezing the incorrect values would create a false baseline. The plan explicitly requires not freezing known-incorrect frequency behavior.

### Decision 4: Negative-path test design
**What**: Negative tests use `pytest.raises(AssertionError)` to verify that missing/broken lock fixtures are properly detected.
**Why**: Tests that just assert false conditions would fail in CI. The `pytest.raises` pattern validates the detection logic itself, not just the condition.
